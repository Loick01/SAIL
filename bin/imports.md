```
import m1;
import m2;
```

when module has imports, we resolve them during ast creation,

objective is to get a list of files to compile in left to right order

1. Get list of imports (direct path to filename for now)
2. 


- sailmodule contains links to other sailmodules ? 

problems : 
- error handling with multiple files
